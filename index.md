Hello, my name is __John Long__.

<img src="profile_picture.jpg" alt="profile picture" width="200"/>

I graduated recently from the __University of California - Davis__ with a degree in __Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)__.

I was previously the __Workshop Director__ for [__Quantum Computing at Davis (QCaD)__](https://www.qcatdavis.org/) and currently work as a __Quantum Software Engineer__ for [__If and Only If (Iff) Technologies__](https://iff.bio/).

If you'd like to know more about my previous work or are curious about what Quantum Computing can do for you, please feel free to reach out!
