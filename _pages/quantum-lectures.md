The following is a list of recorded lectures I've given on behalf of Quantum Computing at Davis (QCaD) to help those interested in Quantum Computing learn the subject.

For sessions where recording was unavailable, the slides are still linked here and have been denoted with an asterisk (*) after the title in the bullet point.

#### Spring Quarter 2020
__NOTE:__ Some of the earlier lectures were recorded through a free copy of Zoom. As a result, you may notice that I notify users to switch over to "another link" as a way to bypass the 40 minute time limit.

#### Winter Quarter 2020
__NOTE:__ The following recordings were done through Facebook Live as QCaD's first "experiment" with live streaming. Although audience reach was excellent, the recording quality is admittedly shaky/noisy due to the fact that this is being recorded by phone.
* [Introductory Quantum Mechanics*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cT4mN_7Xwq9CQbmItj8G5Xkx9FDupP2C4OvDOpZQbuQ/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Multi-Qubit States and Gates](https://www.facebook.com/QCUCD/videos/580490399212848/)
  * [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OF_hRZ5Y9TpOQpFcDkFgDiWiafucWP2VE_r4FjdguXk/edit?usp=sharing)
  * [Follow-Up Questions](https://www.facebook.com/QCUCD/videos/2557462857835006/)
