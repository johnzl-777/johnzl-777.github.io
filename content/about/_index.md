# About

{{ figure(src="/profile-pictures/helsinki.jpg", width="250") }}

I'm a Software Developer during the day and an enjoyer of poetry and cocktails in the evenings (: 

I spend a lot of my free time experimenting with my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) setup to capture more of the rabbit holes I go down for fun such as [which living thing has the largest genome](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(24)01111-8) to [Quantum Chemistry](https://store.doverpublications.com/products/9780486691862). I also enjoy spending a great deal of time at the library and taking nice long walks (weather permitting). 

I also love retrocomputing! I have many fond memories poking around old MS-DOS capable machines from the recycling center as a kid and adore the noisier and closer to bare-metal nature of them. I still remember the delight of [dumping old EPROMs with my Arduino Mega](https://github.com/johnzl-777/EPROM-Dumper) when I was younger.

I was born and raised in California but moved to Massachusetts shortly after I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [UC Davis](https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/). While I certainly miss the dry summers and mild winters of Sacramento, working on software (and even a little hardware!) for quantum computers has been an extraordinary experience.

I don't have one myself but I also _adore_ cats. So much so my desk at work has a dedicated corner for cat figurines! :3
